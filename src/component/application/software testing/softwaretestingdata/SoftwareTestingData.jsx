        "Manual testing is testing of the software where tests are executed manually by a QA Analyst. It is performed to discover bugs in software under development.",
        "In Manual testing, the tester checks all the essential features of the given application or software.",
        "In this process, the software testers execute the test cases and generate the test reports without the help of any automation software testing tools.",

      disadvantages: [
        "Less reliable testing method because it’s conducted by a human. Therefore, it is always prone to mistakes & errors.",
        "The manual testing process can’t be recorded, so it is not possible to reuse the manual test.",
        "In this testing method, certain tasks are difficult to perform manually which may require an additional time of the software testing phase.",
